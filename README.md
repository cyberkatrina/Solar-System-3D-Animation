The user is able to move the camera around the sceen by clicking and dragging. In addition a zoom in zoom out feature was added by using the scroll wheel.

The Earth class sets up the earth like planet and its respective moon to revolve around the sun and rotate the earth and make the moon revolve around the earth.
The Saturn class sets up the Saturn like planet and its rings to revolve around the sun and also rotate on its axis. The rings rotate in the opposite direction of the planet's rotation.
The Asteroid class sets up the asteroids to move across the scene and split into smaller asteroid chunks before resetting.
